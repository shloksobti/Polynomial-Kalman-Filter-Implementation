# Polynomial-Kalman-Filter-Implementation
This repository contains code for implementations of a simple Kalman Filter as well as an implementation to facilitate aiding between GPS and INS. This implementation has been derived from the example outlined in the book, â€œFundamentals of Kalman Filtering: A Practical Approach" (Page 632 - 642).

## Simple Kalman Filter
This filter is a three-state polynomial Kalman filter used to track a vehicle's position. We are assuming in this example that GPS is providing the vehicle location corrupted by zero-mean Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 50 ft. The exact parameters can be found in the cited textbook.

The above screenshot is a simulated result of using a simple Kalman filter, with 100 lost data points. One can see that as long as GPS data is available the kalman filter estimation is good; however, when data is unavailable, the the estimation becomes drastically unreliable. This is seen more clearly in the error plot below.
